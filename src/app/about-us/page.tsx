        An important tool to prevent plagiarism is to detect instances of
        plagiarism by comparing the data present in a text. This is extremely
        important to prevent intellectual property theft. Without this, there
        remains doubt in the presence of credibility and originality. It can be
        used for personal or professional purposes.
